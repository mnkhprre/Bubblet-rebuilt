1.) How to play Bubblet...
--------------------------
Playing Bubblet is very easy! The only thing you have to do is to click at
-at least- two Bubbles of the same color, which are connected to each other.
The more Bubbles aligned together the more Bubble-Points you get! If you click
Bubbles that are connected, they get highlighted. If you click them
again they get bursted. All Bubbles above the bursted ones will fall down.

2.) Different Game-Styles
-------------------------
Bubblet has four Game-Styles! Just try them out by changing 'em in
the Setup-Screen!

3.) Register Bubblet!
---------------------
I'd be very happy if some people would register Bubblet, so that i can go on
making updates and other cool games! ;-) Please support the concept of Shareware!

4.) Original Game
-----------------
The original Bubblet-Game has been created by Frank Fejes (frank@oopdreams.com) for the
PalmPilot. Take a look at it: www.oopdreams.com.
